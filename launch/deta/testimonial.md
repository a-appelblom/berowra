Without Deta Space & Cloud, building Berowra would have been a massive pain in the neck. I say that for three key reasons:

1. **Publishing:** I've heard a fair few horror stories from friends around using the App Store and publishing on it for example. Deta Space was nothing like that, all I had to do was run `deta deploy` and the users of Berowra could update their app to use my new code. 
2. **Taking Auth Off My Mind:** On a higher level, this model of publishing allowed me to act like I was building this app for one person and I didn't have to worry about authentication, nor keeping parts of my app private. Deta Space handled that all for me, reducing the burden on me as the developer. 
3. **Functionality of Deta Base**: This is a very niche scenario but when I was adding filters to my in-app API, I found it super handy to use Deta Base's filtering as the base for the function. It's an example of the very many handy functions Deta provides.
4. **A Helping Hand:** A bonus reason! When ever I got stuck, reaching out on the Deta Slack / Discord always let me move pass those issues. It was super great to have the Deta team be so responsive.

Totally would recommend building on Deta Space, it's a ton of fun.
