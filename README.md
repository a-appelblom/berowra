# ðŸš£ Berowra

A CMS & CDN built for [Deta Space](https://deta.space) during [Deta VC](https://deta.vc). Deploy it with one click [here](https://deta.space/discovery/berowra) and own all of your data with no concern about infrastructure.

Berowra has the following features:
- Build collections of content pieces
- Use multiple field types in your content pieces
- Upload files and host them on Deta Base
- Fetch your content with a great API

This project is split into two parts: `web` and `api`. `web` contains almost all of the application built with Python & Flask and `api` contains the code for the API built in Node.js.

If you require support or locate a bug please open a GitHub Issue [here](https://github.com/sampoder/berowra/issues/new/choose).
