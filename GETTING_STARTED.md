# Getting Started

ðŸ‘‹ Howdy friend! I heard you were looking to get started with Berowra! Well you've came to the right place... in this little piece, we'll be exploring building a pizza review website.

1. First up you're going to want to install Berowra, head to https://deta.space/discovery/berowra and click the big blue `Install` button!
2. Select Berowra in the App Library and let it launch!
3. Next up, select `New Collection`: <br /> <img src="https://cloud-cusao41w8-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/2screenshot_2021-07-24_at_12.48.29_pm.png" width="400" />
4. We're now going to want to create a template for each piece of content, in this case we'll want to create a numbers field to give each pizza joint a rating out of five and a files field to upload photos of the pizza at each shop. <br /> <img src="https://cloud-a4awp4wjh-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2021-08-09_at_12.13.37_pm.png" width="400" /> 
5. We'll be redirected home, here we want to select our `Pizza Reviews!` collection  <br /> <img src="https://cloud-i5kwb8i15-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2021-08-09_at_12.14.22_pm.png" width="400" />  
6. And then we'll choose `Create New` to create a new pizza review  <br /> <img src="https://cloud-bo5j44duv-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2021-08-09_at_12.14.25_pm.png" width="400" />
7. Now, we're going to need to fill out the template. I'm going to review Joe's Pizza and give it a 4 star rating. Make sure to select Published, only published content will be returned by the API. <br /> <img src="https://cloud-lllhjgyqf-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2021-08-10_at_4.39.35_pm.png" width="400" />
8. Speaking of an API, we can now fetch all of our Pizza reviews at the end point shown on the API page. Let's head there now. <br /> <img src="https://cloud-5z8pzd8fv-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0screenshot_2021-08-10_at_4.40.55_pm.png" width="400" />
9. As I alluded to earlier, we can then open the endpoint displayed. We can append `?content` for even more details.
10. Before I leave you to let your explore, I'd also like to point out the filtering feature! I can append `?content.6348025765512.value!gt=3` to get all which have a rating higher then three. It's important to note your field ID fill be different so check the API response for that.

And that's a wrap! All the best on your adventures with Berowra :D
